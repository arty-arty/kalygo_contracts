# Plan of Attack

- Allowing buyer pull out and arbitration flags at valid points
- Allowing seller to set arbitration flags at valid points
- Write tests for various scenarios [has begun]

- Need to add to `generate_test_accounts.sh` -> needs to prefund accounts with ASA amounts as well

WIN GHH3!
